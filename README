RetroFF app transcodes media with paralel instances of ffmpeg

Settings defined in settings.json, will look for this file in the app home directory
The script will be packaged with its settings in Program Files,
And environmental variable PATH will be edited to that the script runs universally 
If the home directory is changed, be sure to change the PATH variable

Examples with powershell
C:\PS> retroFF.ps1 -folder "C:\test"
    <Transcodes full folder contents into C:\test\transcoded>
C:\PS> retroFF.ps1 -file "C:\test\test_video.mxf"
    <Transcodes file into C:\test\transcoded>
C:\PS> retroFF.ps1 -file "C:\test\test_video.mxf" -log
    <Transcodes file into C:\test\transcoded, and leaves logs in C:\test\logs>
C:\PS> retroFF.ps1 -file "C:\test\test_video.mxf" -settings
    <Transcodes file into C:\test\transcoded, and leaves logs in C:\test\logs>
